This is the cupcake opengl package. I have moved it here to allow 1.1 sdk phones to run against 
the updated GLSurfaceView. I have had to rename the package because I was seeing odd things
when running it on a 1.5 SDK Phone. The class linkers seemed to be picking up a different
version of the surfaceview i.e the one in the main sdk. Ultimately it doesn't matter as long
as it works.
